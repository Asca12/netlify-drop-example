# netlify-drop-example

This is a basic repository one can use to drag and drop to [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

See it in action [https://netlify-drop-example.netlify.app](https://netlify-drop-example.netlify.app)

Simple two page site, with favicon, simple styles, headers and redirects, and a contact form.

```
.
├── _headers
├── _redirects
├── contact.html
├── favicon.ico
├── index.html
└── style.css
```

Download, edit, then visit [Netlify Drop](http://netlify.com/drop) to deploy. Simple!

## Other Options

If you are looking to utilise [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/) I have another repository [coelmay/netlify-bare](https://github.com/coelmay/netlify-bare) which includes functions.

And a bare-bones `create-react-app` example [coelmay/netlify-react-bare](https://github.com/coelmay/netlify-react-bare)
